# Dialogflow CX : MyInvestmentBasket
#### Chatbot to make/cutomise a basket and share!
Manual Decision making for short term investment using fundamental,social,CS, complex statistical patterns is errorinous by human and inferior in accuracy, if we comare with machine learning based AI. Our data driven AI process brings more insights to users

##### That's it. More books to read,chatbot to make the the things easier and share!
During COVID we are passing a stessful state, also we are observing economics and financial market are stressed too. 
Chatbot can make or customise a basket for investment. During this time, who has stock market knowledge can use this chatbot and share to families and network to let them know the opportunities, let your network informed.

### Solution
I believe all investors can do analysis or they can do better with chatbot. This chatbot assists short term investors to make their decisions strategically and efficiently in a shorter time. This will help them to use their own hidden analytical mind to fuel wealth creation journeys through AI. No emotion, no arithmancy, calculated greed! 

Afterall stock market in the short term is risky and noisy but this chatbot in the development stack will help keep investors integrated. That will help them to be systematic, strategic in making money efficiently. 

The BigQuery, GCS, AI notebook to make ML models in stack and external private API to make this chatbot highly data data driven (this part is private not open-sourced) and predictive. Dialogflow CX absolutely make designer and developer's work easier, we will be using it to integrate with the Django frontend.
